In this project, I conducted thorough data analysis and hyperparameter tuning on multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest, KNN, and SVM. Understanding the critical importance of minimizing false positive rates in healthcare, I focused on balancing precision (83%) and recall (97%) to ensure that the model not only performed well in identifying true positives but also reduced the likelihood of false alarms. This approach was crucial in developing a model that is both reliable and effective for real-world applications.
